# Snake3001
A remake of the classic game Snake, but in 3D and with Raytracing, as well as some cool visual effects. Originally made for a school project by [@peabrainiac](https://github.com/peabrainiac), [@Alexandros444](https://github.com/Alexandros444), [@jakopokaj](https://github.com/jakopokaj) and more or less [@kingazazael](https://github.com/kingazazael) and [@lasselehmann](https://github.com/lasselehmann).

## Run as a jar file
To play the game, just download the .jar-File from the latest [release](https://github.com/Alexandros444/Snake3001/releases) and run it.
Sometimes the windows defender or some other antivirus-program may block downloaded jar files from running proberly - in that case you may need to run it from the command line or a batch file in order to work. One such batch file is also available for download on the releases page.

## Run with Eclipse
You can also import the project in eclipse to run it from there and make changes to the source code if you want. To do that, just click on "Open Project from File System" in Eclipse and choose the folder with the source code (that is, the one containing this readme-file).
